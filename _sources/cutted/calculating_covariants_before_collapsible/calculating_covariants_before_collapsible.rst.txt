Calculating covariants
----------------------

In the previous tutorial, we calculated invariant representations of
atomic environments and used them for prediction of energies - invariant
properties.

In case when there is need to predict covariant properties, covariants
instead of invariants are required. This tutorial shows how to calculate
them.

First of all, we need to get **fitted** instance of model as in the
previous tutorial. It is done by the following preliminaries cell: (with
the only difference that since we want to calculate covariants, we
clearly shouldn't leave covariants branch of the last block empty)
