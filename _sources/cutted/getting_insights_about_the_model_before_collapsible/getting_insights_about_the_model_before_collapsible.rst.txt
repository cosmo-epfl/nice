Getting insights about the model
--------------------------------

In the first tutorial we calculated invariant representations of atomic
environments and used them for prediction of energies.

But it is always good to have some understanding about the model. In
this tutorial it will be shown how to get spectrums of pca along with
number of covariants after each transformation.

First of all we need fitted model. This preliminary cell reproduces
corresponding part of the first tutorial "constructing machine learning
potential: (few hypers are changed)
