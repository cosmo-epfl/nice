NICE
====

NICE (N-body Iteratively Contracted Equivariants) is a set of tools designed for calculation of 
invariant and covariant atomic structure representations. It allows to
automatically select most informative combinations of high order spectrum elements
and perform their efficient computation usring recurrency relations. 

Though being designed specifically for atomistic machine learning, NICE in principle 
can be applied to other machine learning tasks which involves signals in a ball or on a sphere   with necessasity to produce invariant or covariant output.
