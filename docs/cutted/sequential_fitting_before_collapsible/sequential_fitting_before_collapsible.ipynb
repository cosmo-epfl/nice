This information along with the other one, such as regression accuracy might be usefull to select better hypers. Particulary, the most straghtforward way is to select number of pca components, in a such a way to cover the most part of variance, and do it successively from block to block. \n", "\n", "In this case it is very undesirable to fit all parts of the model, including not changed ones from scratch. One possible way around is to do all things by hand, as it was described in the tutorial \"Constructor or non standard_sequence\", but there would be additional headache with packing resulting blocks into a single model with convenient .transform method. Nice toolbox has capabilities to do it very succinctly.\n", "\n", "First of all we need to get spherical expansion coefficients the same way as in previous tutorials:"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.9"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
