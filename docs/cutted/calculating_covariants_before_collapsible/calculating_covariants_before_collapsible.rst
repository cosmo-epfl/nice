Calculating covariants
----------------------

In the previous tutorial we calculated invariant representation of
atomic environment and used to for prediction of energies - invariant
properties.

In case when there is need to predict covariant properties covariants
instead of invariants are required. This tutorial shows how to calculate
them.

First of all we need to get fitted instance of model as in the previous
tutorial. It is done by the following preliminaries cell: (with the only
difference that since we want to calculate covariants, we clearly
shouldn't left covariants branch of the last block empty)
