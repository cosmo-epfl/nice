    "In previous tutorials it was discussed how to perform calculations with standard NICE scheme, which is reflected by class StandardSequence. But NICE toolbox provides broader opportunities. It is possible, for example, to combine latest covariants with each other at each step in order to get 2^n body order features after n iterations. \n",
